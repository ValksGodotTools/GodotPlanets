## Setup
1. Download and install the [latest Godot 4 C# release](https://godotengine.org/)
2. Clone this repository with all its submodules
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template
```

## Roadmap
- Look into properly calculating the normals instead of just doing `.Normalized()` to each vertex. Instead take the neighboring vertices into account when calculating the normal. But getting the neighboring vertices is going to be a pain on its own...
- Textures!
- Water!
- Trees!
- Focal point of view shader!
- Split the chunks into further chunks!

## Reminders
- Generalize camera orbit code so you never have to write it again

## Contributing
Currently looking for programmers to peer review my code.
